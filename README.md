# ResNet_for_Structure_Assignments
This project utilizes a residual network architecture for assigning secondary structures to protein 3D Coordinates.

Files: ResNetBasedStructureAssignmentRunOnDGX2_All3_1_10.ipynb : is the file containing all three models.

Newly created dataset for structure assignments will be available upon request to the corresponding author.

Saved model details are uploaded here. The user can use the saved models directly sothat there is no need to train it again.
